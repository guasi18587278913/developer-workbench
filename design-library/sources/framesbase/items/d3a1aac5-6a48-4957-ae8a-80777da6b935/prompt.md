Build a single-page vanilla HTML/CSS/JS site (no frameworks, served via Vite) for a luxury performance eyewear brand called "Orven". The entire page is a scroll-driven hero experience with two video scrub phases and animated text reveals. Black background, white text, all elements use `mix-blend-mode: difference` to remain visible over any video frame.

---

### GLOBAL SETUP

- **Font:** Google Fonts "Inter Tight" weights 400 and 500. Body uses weight 500.
- **Colors:** Background `#000`, text `#fff`. No other page background colors.
- **Grid System:** 12-column CSS grid, 24px column-gap, 32px inline padding. CSS custom properties: `--gap: 24px`, `--margin: 32px`, `--ease-expo: cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)`.
- **Reset:** `* { margin: 0; box-sizing: border-box }`, `overscroll-behavior: none` on html and body.
- **Dev grid overlay:** A fixed 12-column red-tinted overlay (hidden by default, toggled with "G" key press). Each column is `rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.1)`.

---

### SECTION 1: FIXED HEADER

- Position: fixed, top 24px, full width, height 58px, padding-inline 32px, z-index 100, `mix-blend-mode: difference`.
- Layout: 4 flex columns (equal width `flex: 1 1 0`).
  - **Column 1 (logo):** Text "Orven(R)" at 24px, letter-spacing -0.04em, vertically centered.
  - **Column 2:** Three stacked lines (14px, letter-spacing -0.03em): "Precision engineered", "Essential", "Proven". Left-aligned, 8px gap, left border `1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.1)`, padding 0 24px.
  - **Column 3:** Two stacked lines (same style): "Innovation Redefined", "Our Story". Same border/padding.
  - **Column 4:** Right-aligned, single line "+ Cart". Same border styling, padding `0 0 0 24px`.

### SECTION 2: HERO (scroll height 1200vh)

The hero section is `position: relative; height: 1200vh`. Inside is a sticky container (`position: sticky; top: 0; height: 100vh; overflow: hidden`) containing:

- **Black backdrop** (absolute, inset 0, background #000).
- **Video 2** (behind video 1 in DOM order, starts at opacity 0):
  - URL: `https://d8j0ntlcm91z4.cloudfront.net/user_38xzZboKViGWJOttwIXH07lWA1P/hf_20260712_221651_c3c6edb9-c684-4a9f-b193-fee556ca5622.mp4`
  - Attributes: muted, playsinline, preload="auto". Absolute positioned, object-fit: cover.
- **Video 1** (on top, starts at opacity 1):
  - URL: `https://d8j0ntlcm91z4.cloudfront.net/user_38xzZboKViGWJOttwIXH07lWA1P/hf_20260712_221520_90005dc3-c311-4138-a49f-e22a719f7d8a.mp4`
  - Same attributes/styling.

#### Hero UI Overlay (fixed, mix-blend-mode: difference)

- Position: fixed, inset 0, height 100vh, uses the 12-column grid, content aligned to bottom (`align-content: end`), padding-bottom 33px, pointer-events none (children get pointer-events auto).

- **Left cluster (grid-column 1/7):**
  - `<h1>` title "Orven(R)" at 160px, font-weight 500, line-height 100%, letter-spacing -0.04em.
  - Paragraph below: "Performance optics engineered for crystal vision. Precision-crafted lenses tested for durability. Superior technology. Built for excellence" -- 18px, line-height 120%, letter-spacing -0.04em, text-indent 120px.

- **Right cluster (grid-column 9/13):**
  - Min-height 176px, flex column with space-between.
  - Row with label "Info" (width 120px, 18px) and text paragraph (flex 1, 18px, text-indent 120px): "Advanced lens engineering meets optical excellence. Every frame tested for impact resistance. Precision optics drive performance vision forward"
  - Meta row: two spans "(Drop)" and "(2026)" with 25px gap, 18px.

---

### SECTION 3: FEATURE PANELS (fixed overlay, z-index 60)

- Container: fixed, inset 0, padding-top 82px, pointer-events none, `mix-blend-mode: difference`, uses the same 12-column grid.
- Two panels sharing grid-row 1:

**Right Panel (grid-column 9/12):**
- 95px x 2px gradient bar: `linear-gradient(90deg, #888DCC 0%, #02B5B8 25.96%, #868D0A 55.77%, #B2A2B6 95.19%)`, aligned flex-end.
- Body with 80px gap between text and specs list.
- Text (32px, weight 400, line-height 120%, letter-spacing -0.04em, text-indent 120px): "Precision-ground lenses hold razor clarity from edge to edge. Tuned to kill glare, lift contrast, and stay flawless through speed, sweat, and grit."
- Specs list (below a 1px white divider, 12px gap rows):
  - Row: white bar (6x14px) | "Clarity" | "98%"
  - Row: white bar | "Contrast" | "94%"
  - Row: white bar | "UV Filter" | "400nm" | "100%"
  - Labels/values: 14px, uppercase, letter-spacing -0.03em, nowrap. Values right-aligned.

**Left Panel (grid-column 2/5):**
- Same structure as right panel.
- Text: "Aerospace-grade polymer flexes under load and springs back unbroken. Built to swallow impact, shed heat, and stay locked through every hard mile."
- Specs:
  - "Frame Weight" | "22g"
  - "Impact Rating" | "Z87+"
  - "Field" | "180 degrees" | "Wide"

### SECTION 4: NEXT (placeholder)

- Simple `<section>` with min-height 100vh, background #000.

### ANIMATIONS & SCROLL BEHAVIOR

**Scroll timeline constants:**
- SCRUB1_VH = 3 (video 1 scrub duration in viewport heights)
- FADE_VH = 3 (crossfade duration)
- SCRUB2_VH = 5 (video 2 scrub duration)
- Total hero height = (3 + 3 + 5 + 1) * 100vh = 1200vh

**Phase 1 (0 to 3vh scroll): Video 1 Scrub**
- Video 1 currentTime is scrubbed from 0 to its full duration based on scroll progress 0-1.
- Hero UI text stays visible through first 80% of this phase.
- At 80-100% of phase 1, hero UI fades out (opacity 1 to 0) and drifts up 120px via translateY. Per-word dissolve triggers at 85% (uiFade > 0.15).

**Phase 2 (3vh to 6vh scroll): Crossfade**
- Video 1 opacity goes 1 to 0 AND gets a blur filter from 0 to 80px.
- Video 2 opacity goes 0 to 1.

**Phase 3 (6vh to 11vh scroll): Video 2 Scrub + Feature Panels**
- Video 2 scrubs from 0 to full duration, reaching its last frame at 80% of this phase (then holds).
- Right panel scrolls through viewport over [0%, 40%] of phase 3.
- Left panel scrolls through viewport over [45%, 85%] of phase 3.
- Each panel enters from below the fold (+60px past viewport bottom) and exits fully above the fold.
- Panel movement uses `position: relative; top: Npx` (not transform) to avoid GPU layer issues with mix-blend-mode.

**Video Scrub Engine (RAF-lerp):**
- `onScroll` only updates a `target` time. A persistent requestAnimationFrame loop smoothly interpolates `current` toward `target` with LERP factor 0.09.
- Actual `video.currentTime` seeks are throttled: only when drift > 0.02s AND at least 30ms since last seek.
- Videos are primed on `loadedmetadata` with a play()/pause() trick for iOS Safari compatibility.
- RAF loop auto-stops when both scrubbers settle.

**Word/Char Stagger Reveal System:**
- A `splitReveal(el, mode, stagger)` function splits text into `<span class="reveal-word">` elements, each with `--i` (index) and `--stagger` CSS variables.
- Hidden state: opacity 0, blur 10px, translateY 20px.
- `.reveal-active .reveal-word`: opacity 1, blur 0, translateY 0. Transition 0.4s expo-out, staggered by `calc(var(--i) * var(--stagger))`.
- `.reveal-exit .reveal-word`: opacity 0, blur 9px, translateY -28px. Duration 0.3s.
- Title uses char-level split with 0.025s stagger. All other text uses word-level with 0.05s stagger.
- Hero title cluster reveals immediately on page load.
- Right panel text reveals when its scroll sub-progress is between 0.12 and 0.88.
- Left panel text reveals when its scroll sub-progress is between 0.12 and 0.88.
